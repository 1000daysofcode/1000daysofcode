## About Me

* 👨‍💻 I’m a fully self-taught software engineer, especially interested in developing my experience in backend and systems level programming.
* ⚡ I started programming with a commitment to code and/or learn to code for 1+ hour/ day consecutively for 1000 days . The last day of my 1000 days of code challenge is Sunday
 3 March, 2024
* ☁️ I'm currently becoming more "cloud native" through AWS and trying to get proficient with the Rust programming language  🦀
